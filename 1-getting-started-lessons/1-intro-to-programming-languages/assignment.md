# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement

|Explain why web developer would use tool| Explain how, but not why developer would use tool| Did not mention how or why a developer would use tool  |
| Linters: For error checking and style guide. eg. [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) | How to use: Select a Linter thats appropriate for a programming language, configure the Linter and voila! It's ready to use. Downside, developers might become too reliant on linters and may not develop their debugging and code review skills.  |  |
